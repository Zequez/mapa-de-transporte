This was my first full stack application made with Ruby on Rails, it was
developed for my city of Mar del Plata to be able to visualize all the public
transport routes, which at the time there was no easy way to do that.

The project was shortly abandoned when the local government created their own app.
It was nevertheless a good learning experience and opened up opportunities for me.

Right now if you want do utilize the public transport, your best choice is to
use the app [Cuando Llega](https://appsvr.mardelplata.gob.ar/cuando/index.html) which is available for Android and iOS.

After all these years, after the domain has been let expire, and I no longer pay for the
Heroku hosting, I just decided to upload here to showcase it in it's eternal glory.
